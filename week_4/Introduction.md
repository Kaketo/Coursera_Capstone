# Introduction
Nowadays, for many people, restaurants, coffee places and bars are a great way to relax and enjoy themselves during working days and weekends. From Monday to Friday it's usually a place to have a business conversation or just lunch during office hours and during weekends these places can be occupied from morning to evening with people that take pleasure in experiencing new cuisine or having a nice time with their families.
